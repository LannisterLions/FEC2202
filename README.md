# Front-End Capstone: Atelier

## Description

- This project intends to deliver a fully functional web application that meets the requirements and specifications outlined by "project stakeholders." The focus was the front end design and integrating our code base with an existing client API for the product.

- This project was built to test different aspects of our learned materials up to this point into one cohesive group program. i.e. How and where to best manage state with React functional/class/hook components, making efficient API calls using 'axios', modular CSS styling, and using GIT workflow.

- Through this project our group learned how to best manage asyn calls and where to hold our data for a more efficient user experience. We learned GIT workflow best practices to keep a uniform code throughout the process. This was also our first experience working on a project of this size and with a group larger than two persons.
