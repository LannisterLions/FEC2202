# Front-End Capstone: Atelier

## Description
- We are given a client-facing retail web-portal that is fairly outdated, therefore hurting its sales numbers. This project comprises of a complete redesign of the retail portal to address this concern and modernize the site. The focus is to provide the client a minimum viable product. Features implemented will be constrained to the client experience which enables customers to search, browse, add to cart and checkout. It is composed of four components, product overview, related products, questions and answers, reviews and ratings. Each will bring a different functionality to the page.

<!-- - This project was built to test different aspects of our learned materials up to this point into one cohesive group program. i.e. How and where to best manage state with React functional/class/hook components, making efficient API calls using 'axios', modular CSS styling, and using GIT workflow. -->

<!-- - Through this project our group learned how to best manage asyn calls and where to hold our data for a more efficient user experience. We learned GIT workflow best practices to keep a uniform code throughout the process. This was also our first experience working on a project of this size and with a group larger than two persons. -->
